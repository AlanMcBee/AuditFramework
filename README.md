General purpose data change tracking for SQL Server

This work is currently (July 2015) getting some revisions to make it a little cleaner, a little easier to understand, a little more robust.

Also, it very much needs a little documentation, which I am absolutely committed to providing.

The code is a little old (over 4 years) and doesn't represent new techniques and approaches I would use now. Over the next few weeks, I will try to improve the architecture, as well.

Go ahead and submit issues or put questions and comments on the wiki and I will respond.
